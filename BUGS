This is a catchall file for all hfst-related bugs.

- The currently (elsewhere) distributed German transducer, german.hfst, fails
  under hfst-lookup with

  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
    what():  std::bad_alloc
  Aborted

  The optimized lookup version, german.hfst.ol, works fine however.

- Transducer reading will segfault with files which have a header that is
  potentially valid HFST, SFST or OpenFST transducer header but rest of the
  file is faulty.
