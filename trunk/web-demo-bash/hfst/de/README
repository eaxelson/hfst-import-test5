This archive contains the SFST SMOR morphological analyser for German with
Morphisto lexical extensions. SFST is licensed under GPL v2, and Morphisto
under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license, both of
which are included in the archive.

german.hfst is in the standard hfst format.
german.hfst.ol is in the optimized lookup format (run it with hsft-optimized-lookup).

The steps to reproduce these transducers are as follows:

1) Download and install SFST from
	http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html

2) Download Morphisto from http://code.google.com/p/morphisto/ and follow its
instructions

3) Convert the SFST transducer to HFST format with hfst-fst2fst

4) Invert the resulting transducer for morphological analysis with hfst-invert

5) To produce the optimized lookup transducer, use hfst-lookup-optimize
