This is a catchall file for all hfst-related bugs.

- The currently (elsewhere) distributed German transducer, german.hfst, fails
under hfst-lookup with

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
Aborted

The optimized lookup version, german.hfst.ol, works fine however.
