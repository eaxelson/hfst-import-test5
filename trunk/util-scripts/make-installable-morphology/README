make-installable.sh is a script for building a distributable morphology
with a Makefile that installs (for now) an analysis and generation script.
The scripts use (in order of preference) hfst-proc, hfst-lookup and the
Java utility HfstOptimizedLookup. They also could be fancier in output.

It's intended for internal use, so not very user-friendly. It expects an
analysis transducer to exist in the same directory, with the name

	LANGNAME.hfst

Usage is ./make-installable.sh LANGNAME LANGCODE [w], where

	LANGNAME is the English name of the language (eg. italian)
	LANGCODE is the language code (eg. it)
	w is an option for making weighted targets

The output is a directory hfst-LANGNAME-installable.
