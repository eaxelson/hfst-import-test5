 HFST 2.0: Helsinki Finite-State Technology (library and application suite)
============================================================================

This package contains the following sub-packages:

hfst2/			(library)
hfst-tools/		(utilities)
hfst-tools/hfst-lexc/	(lexicon compiler)
hfst-tools/hfst-twolc/	(two-level rule compiler)

This package is for users who want to configure, build and install them all.

INSTALL describes the GNU build system in detail, but for most users the usual

	./configure
	make
	(as root) make install

should result in a local installation and

	(as root) make uninstall

in its uninstallation. If you would rather install in eg. your home directory
(or aren't the system administrator), you can tell ./configure:

        ./configure --prefix=${HOME}
