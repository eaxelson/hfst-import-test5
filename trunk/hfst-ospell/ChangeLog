	  use it in every branch of symbol reading

2012-07-04 07:21  hardwick

	* Fixed problems having to do with reading strings from a
	  transducer in raw
	  memory.

2012-07-03 19:42  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Version that extracts zhfst to memory iff it fits on one throw

2012-07-02 22:19  hardwick

	* Added raw memory constructors and table readers for slurping in
	  transducers
	  from char *

2012-07-02 19:49  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Missing files lol

2012-04-25 16:36  hardwick

	* ...and in that case the final identity states also are greater by
	  one.

2012-04-25 16:33  hardwick

	* When avoiding initial edits, there needs to be an extra inital
	  state before
	  we do any edits. So add the value of options.no_initial to the
	  state range
	  loop.

2012-04-18 14:53  eaxelson

	* Commented out hfst-ospell-cicling from Makefile.

2012-04-18 14:48  hardwick

2012-04-18 11:24  hardwick

	* "else if" instead of incorrect "if" in option handling

2012-04-17 13:23  hardwick

	* --no-string-initial should have transitions to state 1, not 0

2012-03-31 14:06  hardwick

	* Don't exit on empty lines

2012-03-31 13:12  hardwick

	* fallback_spell()

2012-03-19 07:40  hardwick

	* --no-string-initial-correction

2012-03-05 08:58  hardwick

	* Corrected eliminations (hopefully), added --minimum-edit option

2012-02-24 05:02  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Profiled version for fsmnlp-2012 measurementsÂ§

2011-11-08 11:18  hardwick

	* Don't skip state numbers when certain options are turned off
	  (and don't print debugging lines)

2011-11-08 11:16  hardwick

	* Corrections to redundancy elimination

2011-11-01 13:55  hardwick

	* redundancy elimination was being performed one state too late
	  (too little)

2011-10-25 10:40  hardwick

	* Add option to disable redundancy elimination

2011-10-25 10:35  hardwick

	* Initial support for redundancy elimination
	  (refuse to do insertion after deletion or deletion after
	  insertion)

2011-10-11 19:30  hardwick

	* Bugfix: identity transitions were being forgotten in the last
	  edit state

2011-10-07 10:28  hardwick

	  know about

	* Lines that start with ## are comments

2011-09-28 08:24  hardwick

	* Updated help message & added exclusion of symbols by prepending a
	  ~

2011-09-28 07:44  hardwick

	* Wrap stderr with a utf-8 codec so we can print non-ascii symbols
	  when verbose

2011-09-28 07:32  hardwick

	* Write alphabet with weights when verbose

2011-09-28 07:24  hardwick

	* Order of preference of alphabet definition is now
	  configfile - commandline - transducer.
	  If configfile gives a weight after a tab for symbols,
	  they are used additively for all edits involving those symbols.

2011-09-28 06:42  hardwick

	* Some clarifying comments

	* Rescue identities from being considered substitutions

2011-09-28 05:50  hardwick

	* Add verbose, quiet

2011-09-01 21:41  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* * parse all of the metadata if possible
	  * use c++ ``struct''s for metadata

2011-09-01 21:36  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* * Use temporary filenames by tmpsnam
	  * Do not delete Transducers in data structures since it will
	  segfault all
	  enchant-based applications in dtor

2011-08-31 08:56  hardwick

	* libhfst-style exception macros and some more informative messages

	* Example from: http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html and similar
	  tests

2011-07-20 11:22  hardwick

	* The test for final weighted transitions involves
	  target_index == 1 instead of weight == INFINITE_WEIGHT
	  
	  (I wish I remembered why this was changed)

2011-07-20 07:44  hardwick

	* Fixed bug involving bytewise casting of longs to floats (I
	  misunderstood
	  what static_cast really does I guess).

2011-05-24 10:19  hardwick

	* fread returns element count, not byte count

2011-05-09 19:22  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* duplicate definitions

	* Ignore (autotools-)generated files.

2011-02-22 01:20  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* MSVC fixes:
	  * include <string> when using strinG
	  * use boolean operators instead of aliases?

	* Misc. nonfunctional cleanup

2010-08-11 18:15  hardwick

	* Hack to make the test script handle unicode

2010-08-11 18:10  hardwick

	* Added character swaps to edit distance script. You have to enable
	  them with
	  the -s flag - they generate A(A-1)*D new states and twice that
	  many
	  transitions, where A is the size of the alphabet and D is the
	  edit distance.
	  Pretty expensive. Is there a better way?

2010-08-11 17:37  hardwick

	* Improvements to editdist.py - see test/editdist.py --help

2010-08-11 16:52  hardwick

	* Put 1.0 weights on the test generator script

2010-08-11 16:44  hardwick

	* Better checking of read operations, added relevant exceptions

2010-08-09 22:25  hardwick

	* Made example formatting in README more consistent - I may have
	  broken
	  Tommi's commit a bit, but I think it's ok now...

2010-08-09 22:21  hardwick

	* Minor improvement to demo

2010-08-09 22:02  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Static lib and fixes to xamples in readme

2010-08-09 22:00  hardwick

	* Added comment

2010-08-09 20:44  hardwick

	* Reversed previous commit, which did the opposite of what the
	  commit message
	  said it would. Committer will go to bed now...

2010-08-09 20:41  hardwick

	* Return results in reverse order by weight, ie. in order of
	  quality
	  (instead of the opposite)

	  sure each
	  correction string only appears once

2010-08-09 13:37  hardwick

	* Fatal bug(s) fixed, (more) correct flag diacritic functionality

2010-08-06 12:10  hardwick

	* New test script

2010-08-06 12:05  hardwick

	* Fixed typo

2010-08-06 11:59  hardwick

	* Fixed a braindead bug that subtly broke everything, this should
	  make
	  some code redundant

2010-08-02 13:46  hardwick

	* A way to handle flag diacritics

2010-07-08 15:33  hardwick

	* Trivial Makefile fix for commandline tester

2010-07-08 15:26  hardwick

	* Added README and some fixes

2010-07-08 14:46  hardwick

	  documentation,
	  proper packaging and esp. functioning flag diacritics still to be
	  done.

2010-07-05 11:05  hardwick

	* Temporarily de-autotooled ospell

2010-06-22 14:38  moshagen

	* Corrected typo.

2010-06-21 20:26  moshagen

	* Ignore generated binary.

2010-06-21 17:29  hardwick

	* Initial commit of hfst-ospell.
	  Basic functionality including OTHER symbol (@?@) and runtime
	  alphabet
	  translation is present; weighted transducers (probably to be the
	  only option)
	  and flag diacritic states for the mutator and lexicon
	  forthcoming.
