	* Preparing for 0.2.3 release.

2013-04-26 14:34  moshagen

	* Changed version number to 0.2.3, and renamed the package and tool
	  name to 'hfst-ospell', since that is what the command-line tool
	  is actually called, and it is consistent with the rest of the
	  hfst tool names.

2013-04-26 12:44  hardwick

	* Should fix #176
	  Flag state from the stack back was getting clobbered in some

2013-02-04 13:54  hardwick

	  nodes getting removed. This appears fo fix a very long-standing
	  and serious bug dating from r2763.

2013-01-16 12:46  hardwick

	* When data is in memory, allocate & copy it in ospell rather than
	  expect caller to keep track of it (which it usually doesn't)

	* Forgot some important checks that we actually want to limit the
	  results

2012-09-20 16:27  hardwick

	* Enforce an n-best limit for continuing the search, just for
	  breadth-first for
	  now

2012-09-04 19:11  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Whitespace change only in configure.ac. More generated files to
	  ignore.

2012-08-15 03:57  moshagen

	* Added some whitespace to ease readability. Replaced pattern rules
	  with suffix rules to make automake happy.

2012-08-14 20:19  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Fix compilation without xml,
	  as suggested by Harri Pitkänen on libvoikko-devel

2012-07-02 19:49  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Missing files lol

2012-04-25 16:36  hardwick

	* ...and in that case the final identity states also are greater by
	  one.

2012-04-25 16:33  hardwick

	* When avoiding initial edits, there needs to be an extra inital
	  state before
	  we do any edits. So add the value of options.no_initial to the
	  state range
	  loop.

2012-04-18 14:53  eaxelson

	* Commented out hfst-ospell-cicling from Makefile.

2012-04-18 14:48  hardwick

	* Comment out missing cicling target

2012-03-19 07:40  hardwick

	* --no-string-initial-correction

2012-03-05 08:58  hardwick

	* Corrected eliminations (hopefully), added --minimum-edit option

2012-02-24 05:02  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Profiled version for fsmnlp-2012 measurements§

2011-11-08 11:18  hardwick

	* Don't skip state numbers when certain options are turned off
	  (and don't print debugging lines)

2011-11-08 11:16  hardwick

	* Corrections to redundancy elimination

2011-11-01 13:55  hardwick

	* redundancy elimination was being performed one state too late
	  (too little)

2011-10-25 10:40  hardwick

	* Add option to disable redundancy elimination

2011-10-25 10:35  hardwick

	* Initial support for redundancy elimination
	  (refuse to do insertion after deletion or deletion after
	  insertion)

2011-10-11 19:30  hardwick

	* Bugfix: identity transitions were being forgotten in the last

	* Updated help message & added exclusion of symbols by prepending a
	  ~

2011-09-28 07:44  hardwick

	* Wrap stderr with a utf-8 codec so we can print non-ascii symbols
	  when verbose

2011-09-28 07:32  hardwick

	* Write alphabet with weights when verbose

2011-09-28 07:24  hardwick

	* Order of preference of alphabet definition is now
	  configfile - commandline - transducer.
	  If configfile gives a weight after a tab for symbols,
	  they are used additively for all edits involving those symbols.

2011-09-28 06:42  hardwick

	* Some clarifying comments

	* Rescue identities from being considered substitutions

2011-09-28 05:50  hardwick

	* Add verbose, quiet

2011-09-01 21:41  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* * parse all of the metadata if possible
	  * use c++ ``struct''s for metadata

2011-09-01 21:36  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* * Use temporary filenames by tmpsnam
	  * Do not delete Transducers in data structures since it will
	  segfault all
	  enchant-based applications in dtor

2011-08-31 08:56  hardwick

	* libhfst-style exception macros and some more informative messages

	  tests

2011-07-20 11:22  hardwick

	* The test for final weighted transitions involves
	  target_index == 1 instead of weight == INFINITE_WEIGHT
	  
	  (I wish I remembered why this was changed)

2011-07-20 07:44  hardwick

	* Fixed bug involving bytewise casting of longs to floats (I
	  misunderstood
	  what static_cast really does I guess).

2011-05-24 10:19  hardwick

	* fread returns element count, not byte count

2011-05-09 19:22  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* duplicate definitions

2011-05-09 19:04  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Ignore (autotools-)generated files.

2011-02-22 01:20  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* MSVC fixes:

2010-08-11 18:15  hardwick

	* Hack to make the test script handle unicode

2010-08-11 18:10  hardwick

	* Added character swaps to edit distance script. You have to enable
	  them with
	  the -s flag - they generate A(A-1)*D new states and twice that
	  many
	  transitions, where A is the size of the alphabet and D is the
	  edit distance.
	  Pretty expensive. Is there a better way?

2010-08-11 17:37  hardwick

	* Improvements to editdist.py - see test/editdist.py --help

2010-08-11 16:52  hardwick

	* Better checking of read operations, added relevant exceptions

2010-08-09 22:25  hardwick

	* Made example formatting in README more consistent - I may have
	  broken
	  Tommi's commit a bit, but I think it's ok now...

2010-08-09 22:21  hardwick

	* Minor improvement to demo

2010-08-09 22:02  Tommi A Pirinen <tommi.pirinen@helsinki.fi>

	* Static lib and fixes to xamples in readme

2010-08-09 22:00  hardwick

	* Added comment

2010-08-09 20:44  hardwick

	* Reversed previous commit, which did the opposite of what the
	  commit message
	  said it would. Committer will go to bed now...

2010-08-09 20:41  hardwick

	* Return results in reverse order by weight, ie. in order of
	  quality
	  (instead of the opposite)

	  sure each
	  correction string only appears once

2010-08-09 13:37  hardwick

	* Fatal bug(s) fixed, (more) correct flag diacritic functionality

2010-08-06 12:10  hardwick

	* New test script

2010-08-06 12:05  hardwick

	* Fixed typo

2010-08-06 11:59  hardwick

	* Fixed a braindead bug that subtly broke everything, this should
	  make
	  some code redundant

2010-08-02 13:46  hardwick

	* A way to handle flag diacritics

2010-07-08 15:33  hardwick

	* Trivial Makefile fix for commandline tester

	* Added README and some fixes

2010-07-08 14:46  hardwick

	* Implemented spellchecking and correction library functions;

	  done.

2010-07-05 11:05  hardwick

	* Temporarily de-autotooled ospell

2010-06-30 09:39  hardwick

2010-06-22 14:38  moshagen

	* Corrected typo.

2010-06-21 20:26  moshagen

	* Ignore generated binary.

2010-06-21 17:29  hardwick

	* Initial commit of hfst-ospell.
	  Basic functionality including OTHER symbol (@?@) and runtime
	  alphabet
	  translation is present; weighted transducers (probably to be the
	  only option)
	  and flag diacritic states for the mutator and lexicon
	  forthcoming.
