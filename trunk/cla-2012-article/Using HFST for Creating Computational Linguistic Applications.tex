\begin{abstract}
\sloppy HFST – Helsinki Finite-State Technology (\url{hfst.sf.net})
is a framework for compiling and applying linguistic descriptions
with finite-state
methods. HFST currently connects some of the most important finite-state
tools for creating morphologies and spellers into one open-source
platform and supports extending and improving the descriptions with
weights to accommodate the modeling of statistical information. HFST
offers a path from language descriptions to efficient language
applications.

HFST is designed for compiling morphologies and for that purpose it
contains open-source replicas of xfst, lexc and twolc which are
well-known and well-researched tools for morphology building. They
support both parallel and cascaded application of transducers. In
addition, HFST offers the capability to train and apply part-of-speech
taggers on top of the morphologies using weighted finite-state transducers.

With the morphology and tagger capabilities a number of applications
have been created, e.g. spellers for close to 100 languages and
hyphenators for approximately 40 different languages. The spellers were
derived from open-source dictionaries and integrated with OpenOffice and
LibreOffice. E.g. a full-fledged Greenlandic speller, which is a
polyagglutinating language, is currently available only via HFST for
OpenOffice. Using the tagger capability of HFST, we have created an
improved spelling suggestion mechanism for words in context as well as
better predictive text input for mobile phones for highly inflecting
languages like Finnish. Other writer’s tools created with HFST include
inflecting thesauri and translation dictionaries. We also offer lexicon
compilation and preprocessing for the Apertium machine translation
software.

For the processing of large corpora, e.g. for text indexing purposes, a
high-performing look-up facility is provided with HFST offering
110.000-440.000 words per second of morphological processing. A recent
extension of the look-up facility offers a utility to create named
entity recognizers for information extraction purposes on top of the
lookup.

In table X we present compilation times for different morphologies using 
different HFST backends. The morphologies are OMorFi for Finnish, Morphisto 
for German, Morph-it for Italian, Swelex for Swedish and TrMorph for Turkish 
(todo: add footnotes). OMorFi, Morphisto and Morph-it contain several rules for
inflection and compounding. Morph-it and Swelex are basically word-lists.


\begin{table}
  \caption{Compilation times for different morphologies with
    different HFST backends. The times are expressed in minutes and seconds.}
  \label{tab:compilation_times}
  \begin{tabular}{ c  c  c  c }
    \hline
    Morphology & SFST & OpenFst & foma \\ \hline
    Finnish & 2:48 & 7:52 & 1:52 \\ \hline
    German & 2:12 & 7:45 & 1:33 \\ \hline
    Italian & 0:30 & 2:24 & 0:31 \\ \hline

    Turkish & 0:12 & 0:40 & 0:05 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


In table X we also present the compilation times for Finnish and German compared
with the results that we obtained in our previous benchmarking. The backend
versions are also shown.

\hline
  Back-End                 & version  & Finnish  & German \\ \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{SFST}    & 1.4.2    & 5:02     & 6:39 \\
                           & 1.4.6    & 2:48     & 2:12 \\ \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{OpenFst} & 1.2.7    & 6:51     & 6:28 \\
                           & 1.2.10   & 7:52     & 7:45 \\ \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{foma}    & ?        & 1:49     & 1:29 \\
                           & 0.1.16   & 1:52     & 1:33 \\
\hline
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

It can be clearly seen that the performance of HFST with SFST as backend 
has improved. The current compilation time of the Finnish morphology has almost
halved. The compilation time of the German morphology is only one third of the
result at previous benchmarking. 
This is because SFST has new efficient minimization and composition functions
developed in collaboration with the HFST team.

The performance of HFST with OpenFst as backend has become slower. It is not
clear whether this is because of the newer version of OpenFst or changes in the 
actual HFST code (todo: find out).

The performance of HFST with foma has stayed almost the same, only a minor
growth of couple of seconds can be noticed.
