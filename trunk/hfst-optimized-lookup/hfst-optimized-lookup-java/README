hfst-optimized-lookup-java: a demo utility for lookup on hfst-optimized-lookup
transducers.

You need the Java runtime, a transducer in a special fast-lookup format
(made with separate hfst tools) and this package.

src/ contains .java source files and precompiled .class files.

If you got this from svn, you'll need to compile first, ie.

	javac src/*.java

To run, type (in src/ or wherever you want to install)
"java HfstOptimizedLookup [name of transducer]"
