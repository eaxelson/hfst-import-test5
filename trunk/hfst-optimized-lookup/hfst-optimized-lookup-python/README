hfst-optimized-lookup-python: perform lookup on a fast transducer format

This package performs transducer lookup (transformation) on a specialised
file format. The format is fast, but this Python implementation is not
very fast.

INSTALLATION

You can either install the package or just it in the directory it comes in.
To install, use the standard setup.py. See

   	python setup.py --help


You probably just want (as root)

        python setup.py install

You'll need Python's setuptools to be installed for this to work.

RUNNING

You need the Python interpreter (2.7.x), a transducer in a special
fast-lookup format (made with separate hfst tools) and this package.

The commandline and utility are both provided by hfst_lookup.py. To run the
lookup utility, type 

	./hfst_lookup.py [name of transducer]

or

	python hfst_lookup.py [name of transducer]

If you load hfst_lookup as a module, you can use the class OlTransducer
from it to load and run transducers, like so:

my_transducer = OlTransducer(filename)
for result in my_transducer.analyse(string_to_analyse):
    print result

The results are (string, weight) pairs (Unicode strings and floating point
numbers).
