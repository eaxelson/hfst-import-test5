 HFST 2.0: Helsinki Finite-State Technology (library and application suite)
============================================================================

This package contains the following sub-packages:

hfst2/			(library)
hfst-tools/		(utilities)
hfst-tools/hfst-lexc/	(lexicon compiler)
hfst-tools/hfst-twolc/	(two-level rule compiler)

This package is for users who want to configure, build and install them all.

There's a lot of documentation and other information about HFST at

Installation
------------

INSTALL describes the GNU build system in detail, but for most users the usual

	./configure
	make
	(as root) make install

should result in a local installation and

	(as root) make uninstall

in its uninstallation. If you would rather install in eg. your home directory
(or aren't the system administrator), you can tell ./configure:

        ./configure --prefix=${HOME}

Software in this package is variously distributed under the GPL, LGPL and
Apache licenses. If you want to develop something or include it in your own
software, check which license(s) apply.

In the CVS or SVN version you must create necessary autotools files in the host
system:

  autoreconf -i

It is common practice to keep `generated files out of version control
<http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#CVS>`_.

For further installation instruction refer to file ``INSTALL``, which contains
the standard installation instructions for GNU autoconf based software.

Dependencies
------------

Compilation requirements:

- the linker *should* be able to find library named readline, if the readline
  interface will be used. If readline is missing some components, hfst will not
  contain the readline interface.

- Underlying transducer libraries *may* impose further restrictions; e.g.
  OpenFST may require pthreads library

- Versions loaded from version control systems require a relatively new GNU
  tool-chain to build: autoconf >=2.60, autoconf, libtool >=2.2, >=gettext-0.17.
  GNU tool-chain is also needed with distributed packages if the user wishes to
  modify Makefile.am or configure.ac files.

- Versions loaded from version control systems require GNU flex 2.5.35 and
  bison x.x.xx or compatible. Especially flex 2.5.33 will choke on perfectly
  valid rules used in hfst. Flex and bison are needed with distribution 
  versions as well if the user wishes to modify .yy or .ll files.

Runtime requirements:

- If the executable is dynamically linked (almost always), the operating system
  *must* be able to find hfst and readline libraries.

Further information
-------------------

Each of the sub-packages contained will have their own set of README's and
documentation. The `Hfst wiki site
<https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome>`_ also contains more
details.
