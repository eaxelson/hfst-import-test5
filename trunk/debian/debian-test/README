This is a directory for testing the creation of a debian package for HFST
library and commandline tools and the backend libraries OpenFst, sfst and foma.

First, run make-copy.sh that copies all except svn files to the directory
../debian-test-copy.

Then, go to the directory ../debian-test-copy and run ./make-package there.
It will copy HFST library and commandline tools plus the backend libraries
under directory debian and make the package debian.deb. The script also tests
th integrity of the package and will probably yield some warnings.

To remove all files that were copied when make-package.sh was run,
run the script make-clean.sh.
