This package contains SWIG-generated Python bindings for the
HFST library. To use the bindings, you need
 
 - a compatible version of HFST library installed to /usr/lib/ (can be 
   fetched from http://sourceforge.net/projects/hfst/files/hfst/)
 - Python version 2.5 =< (the package is tested with version 2.7)

To install the bindings, execute

  ./make-install

in this directory. In case of problems, try doing the same as super-user:

  sudo ./make-install

After installation you should be able to use the bindings by writing

  import libhfst

in the beginning of your Python script.
