This package contains SWIG-generated Python bindings for the
HFST library. To use the bindings, you need
 
 - a compatible version of HFST library installed to /usr/lib/ (can be 
   fetched from http://sourceforge.net/projects/hfst/files/hfst/)
 - Python compiler/interpreter

To install the bindings, you need to copy files _libhfst.so and libhfst.py
so that the Python interpreter will find them. For Python2, you must copy
them to

  /usr/lib/python2.X/dist-packages/

where 2.X is the version of Python you wish to use (e.g. 2.7). For any 
version of Python3 it is enough to copy the files to

  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/

as all Python3 interpreters share the same directory.

After installation you should be able to use the bindings by writing

  import libhfst

in the beginning of your Python script.
