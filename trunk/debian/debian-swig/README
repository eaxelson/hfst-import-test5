This directory contains scripts and files needed to make a
debian package of swig-generated python bindings for HFST.

Before you run the scripts in this directory, make sure you
have run the packaging scripts in directory '../debian-test',
i.e. you have a directory '../debian-test-copy' that contains
swig-generated python bindings for HFST (in directory
'../debian-test-copy/hfst-X.Y.Z/swig').

First:

 - Update the version numbers in fields 'Version' and 'Depends'
   in file debian/DEBIAN/control
 - Add a new entry in file 
   debian/usr/share/doc/HFSTPY-DEV/changelog.Debian
 - Update the timestamp in files 
   debian/usr/share/doc/HFSTPY-DEV/copyright and
   debian/usr/share/doc/HFSTPY-DEV/changelog.Debian

Do not change the values of variables HFSTPY etc, they are
later automatically replaced with hfstpy[2|3] etc by packaging
scripts. Commit your changes to trunk. Then run

  ./make-copy.sh && 
  cd ../debian-swig-copy

This will copy all relevant files under ../debian-swig-copy
without the .svn files.

Continue by running

  ./make-debian-package --python2 --hfst-dir /full/path/to/swig/dir/ && 
  ./make-debian-package --python3 --hfst-dir /full/path/to/swig/dir/

where /full/path/to/swig/dir is the swig dir of hfst-X.Y.Z.

At the end, you will have files

  hfstpy2-dev_Y.Z-1_ARCH.deb
  hfstpy3-dev_Y.Z-1_ARCH.deb

where ARCH is amd64 or i386.
