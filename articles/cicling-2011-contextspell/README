README of cicling-2012 context spelling article
===============================================

This package contains all sources and data needed to build the article and
recreate the results described in the article. The licencing of separate pieces
of the system varies, see LICENCE file for details. However, for all pieces of
software where the authors of the article can relicence, the data and software
can be assumed to have free/open licences, such as GPLv3. This is in effect all
dependent software and data, excepting the part-of-speech taggers language
models, which are only available under very restricted commercial licences. Work
is being done to replace these with proper open source data.

Dependencies
------------

The compilation and use of the system requires GNU or compatible text processing
tool chain and C++ compiler collection:

- GNU make

- bash

- g++-4.4.4 (tested, should work on any relatively new g++)

- GNU sed and awk, cat, perl, wget, zip

- OpenFST-1.2.7 or newer (included in package; install first)

- HFST 3.3 or newer (included in package; install first)

- HFST-ospell (included in package; install first)

- xelatex, bibtex from TeXLive 2009 or newer (suggested); latex may work

Usage
-----

Before use, the dependent software included must be installed by standard
installation::

  tar zxvf openfst-1.2.7.tar.gz
  cd openfst-1.2.7
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  (sudo) make install
  cd ..
  tar zxvf hfst-3.3.0.tar.gz
  cd hfst-3.3.0
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  (sudo) make install
  cd ..
  tar zxvf hfstospell-0.2.0.tar.gz
  cd hfstospell-0.2.0
  ./configure
  make
  (sudo) make install
  cd ..

By default the Makefile rebuilds article PDFs::

  make

To rebuild the results in the paper using the same data, context-results target
should be enough::

  make context-results

To rebuild only unigram results (much faster), results target will work::

  make results

The target context-adjustment-results creates small samples of spelling results
with trivial autogenerated error-model for testing and fine-tuning the
parameters and models.

The beginning of the Makefile contains parameters that can be used to tweak the
scaling factors of probabilistic weights.

If you run into any problem, do not hesitate to contact the authors of the paper.
