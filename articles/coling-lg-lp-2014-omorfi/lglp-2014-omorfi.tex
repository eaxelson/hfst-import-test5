\begin{abstract}
    Developing a lexical resource from a high coverage single-purpose morphological
    analyzer to a wide coverage of linguistic applications and end-user products
    is a difficult task. The lexical data coverage needs to be widened to cover
    needs of various applications yet remain consistent and stable for the
    previous applications. In this paper, we present a case study on Finnish
    lexical data developed in recent years, but the insights gained should be
    generally useful for everyone developing lexical data. The development has
    been made by extending a database, and the work was done by linguists and
    language technologists reviewing the classifications and new words, using
    supervised data gathering methods and written grammars.  The lexical
    data has been successfully used in large variety of applications from
    spell-checking and dependency parsing to rule-based machine translation.

For most moderately resourced languages, there exists at least one lexical
resource, such as a morphological analyzer, that has reached a level of high
lexical coverage, e.g., over 95Ìƒ~\% of unrestricted text of any domain.  At that
level the resource will be valuable enough for other researchers as well as
software developers to start using it as a basis for language models for a
large variety of software. In this article, we present a case study of a
lexical resource of Finnish over three years of development from such a basic,
single-project resource into a generally accepted state-of-the-art language
model for a large variety of language technology production chains, such as:
spell-checker~\cite{pirinen2014weighted}, named entity
recognizer~\cite{huovelinsoftware}, dependency parser~\cite{bohnet2013joint}, indexing
tool, machine translation system~\footnote{\url{LG-LP disallows repo URLs}}.
\ldots

The following aspects of language resource handling will be discussed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item gathering new lexical items
    \item linguistic classification and verification
    \item automatic verification and consistency checks
    \item requirements of different applications
\end{itemize}

A central requirement for scaling up a lexical resource to a multitude of
applications is the classification of lexical items. In a part-of-speech
tagger, it may be sufficient that each lexical item belongs to one or more
part-of-speech classes, which are a coarse generalization of the morphological,
syntactic and semantic features. In most end-user applications, a number of
different additional bits of information per lexical entry (including per
morph) needs to be supported, and e.g., the information for named entity
recognition must not interfere with the analysis quality of the morphological
analyzer. To implement this, a separation of the data and the grammar
description was needed in the morphological resource, and our solution explores
a light-weight database structure.

The verifiability and stability of lexical resources can be ensured in two
ways: deploying automatic test suites that ensure the consistency of the data
and the integrity of resulting tools and parsers, and linguistically motivated,
written annotation manuals. In this article, we focus on the latter, although
the system has plenty of automatic tests as well.

The resulting database is provided as a free/open source product in a public
repository for anyone to download and use for other products. We believe that
this aspect is another central concept for sustainable and reproducible NLP
research, and is one that has in the past been omitted especially in case of
Finnish resources but also in general in a large variety of
moderately-resourced languages.

In our work, we faced the fact that conceptual models are not easy to assign
automatically to large amounts of language data, and due to the idiosyncratic
behavior of lexical entries, it is still necessary to examine each entry
suggestion individually to verify that it belongs to the intended category.

In addition, many multi-word expressions are somewhere halfway between
compositional and non-compositional constructs.  While it may sometimes be
beneficial to record frequent compositional constructs, it is often crucial to
record the non-compositional constructs, as non-compositional constructs behave
as individual words. 

Actual implementations of NLP systems and real-world applications provide clues
to what complex lexical and grammatical language-resources they need, but
experiments are required to accurately relate the impact of the features of a
language-resource on the results obtained in an NLP application.  In this
paper, we use a manually annotated and verified gold-standard to represent the
granularity and level of analysis we wish to achieve and evaluate our lexical
analyzer with this gold standard. 

By using manual encoding of information and not only machine-learning on the
gold-standard training data, a high coverage of the training data is to be
expected in the most recent version of our lexical resource. However, we
extended the lessons learned from the training data to new unseen similar cases
while building the lexical resource.  This is expected to show up as general
domain-independent applicability of our resource in future applications.

% Therefore, we will ask for original research related (but not limited to) the following fields:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Lexicography for NLP;
% \item Lexicon/Grammar interface;
% \item Dictionaries and grammars for translation technologies;
% \item Grammars: design, formal specification and quality;
% \item Local grammars;
% \item Ontologies and knowledge representation;
% \item Design and implementation of domain-specific and terminological LRs;
% \item Environments for construction of LRs;
% \item Statistical NLP coupled with existing LRs.
% \end{itemize}

\section{Lexical Data}

Lexical data is managed in a database format using the lemma and sense number
as the primary keys to which we attach all the other information of a lexeme,
such as inflectional paradigm,  part-of-speech as well as syntactic and
semantic subcategories.  This compartmentalization of data allows us to treat
different levels of descriptions separately.  On each level we use model words
to represent the behavior we wish to model, e.g., we say that the name
\emph{Merja} inflects as \emph{kirja}, has the same part-of-speech as
\emph{sarja}, and have syntactic and semantic subcategories in common with
other model words.  In essence, this does not differ from having numbers or
other indexes on paradigms but it makes it easier for someone maintaining the
database to memorize the distinctions. 

The model words represent named clusters to which lexemes belong.  This ties in
with the idea of verifiability and extendibility which we wish to achieve. It
should be possible to infer which of the existing classes a new token most
likely belongs to based on the contexts it appears in.  Listing exceptional
tokens as clusters with only one member, or at most a few members, simplifies
the description of the remaining tokens by making the description of their
behavior more regular.  From a machine-learning perspective, fine-grained
distinctions complicate the  objective function to be learned, but as long as
the distinctions are practically useful and linguistically well-motivated our
lexical clusters are a relevant challenge for machine-learning.  From this
design it follows that, all other context-conditions being equal, a bigger
cluster is more likely to be a good candidate for a new token.  This idea is
capitalized in the category guesser which can be derived from any finite-state
lexicon with the use of \emph{hfst-guessify}~\cite{linden2008assigning}. The
guesser takes the words in the lexicon into consideration.  More advanced
machine-learning techniques are needed to benefit from the surrounding context
in corpora.

In Tables 1, 2 and 3, we characterize the granularity of the lexical database
and the work that has gone into developing it during three years between 2011
and 2014 in terms of lexical items and paradigms of different parts-of-speech.
From an internal Finnish morphological point of view, adjectives, nouns,
pronouns and numerals behave in a similar fashion as nominals taking many of
the same inflections and inflectional paradigms.  Also in Finnish, adverbs,
particles and adpositions either do not inflect or take the same possessives
and clitics.  However, for easier comparison with other languages, we compare
numbers in terms of the Google universal POS tags defined
in~\cite{petrov2011universal}.

\end{table}

In Table 1, we see that the majority of the added lexemes can be found among
the nouns.  A more thorough analysis of the added nouns reveals that a majority
is in the proper noun section.  This is motivated by the named-entity
recognition (NER) application of OMorFi.  In many other languages, it is
possible to add separate gazetteers, i.e. lists of names, to the NER
application itself, but Finnish as a highly inflecting language needs to
analyze the base forms of names as well, so the names need to be included in
the morphological analyzer.  In Table 2, we compare the numbers of nouns in the
two analyzer versions.

        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Number of nouns according to subcategory with a subdivision of the proper noun category}
\end{table}

A quick look at the added adjectives, reveals that they are to a large part a)
of foreign origin, b) lexicalized participles (aistittu [sensed], aistiva
[sensing], aistittava [to be sensed]) , c) compound adjectives (aivokuollut
[brain dead], epÃ¤siisti [unclean]), d) related to place names (ahlaislainen
[of/from Ahlainen]) and e) derivations with -inen [-ful] and -ton [-less]. 

A majority of the added verbs are of foreign origin (hydroloida [hydrolate]), compound verbs (ilmajÃ¤Ã¤hdyttÃ¤Ã¤ [air-condition]) or term-like neologisms (hamontaa [render]), but also some added verbs are transformational derivatives (grillailla [to be grilling]) as well as some of more colloquial style (hÃ¤ippÃ¤istÃ¤ [leave without trace or explanation]).

Adverbs have both increased and decreased. Previously 111 words classified as
adverbs are now only adpositions or particles, whereas approximately 400 new
adverbs are lexicalized forms of nouns.  In addition, there are approx. 50
lexicalized comparative or superlative forms of adverbs.

The majority of additional numbers are compound numbers that have been
explicitly included in the lexicon.

In addition, the inflection information of the words in OMorFi has also been
made more fine-grained to serve e.g. spelling correction purposes.  As can be
seen in Table 3, the number of noun paradigms has increased dramatically as
words appearing only in singular or only in plural had their own paradigms.
This warranted a shift from explicitly numbered paradigms to a more intuitive
way of naming the paradigms according to one representative of the paradigm.
There were previously three different systems for classifying Finnish
inflectional paradigms with slightly different granularity intended mostly for
human consumption in dictionaries which made it possible to hide some details
that were subsequently listed as exceptional behavior for individual lexemes.
The current approach is to have as many paradigms as needed which allows an
exact description giving rise to some singletons.

\section{Development Motivated by Linguistics}

Finnish TreeBank for annotating a corpus of linguistically interesting examples
representing the whole spectrum of linguistic phenomena in Finnish.  Some
linguistic phenomena may be rare which means that annotating unrestricted text
may require a substantial amount of data to cover all the phenomena.  Using a
corpus of examples from a the large Finnish grammar \cite{visk}, we are
able to cover the whole spectrum in a limited space.  In addition, various
aspects of the same phenomena are listed next to each other, which means that
designing a gold standard is less time consuming.

The gold standard for dependency syntax analysis was developed already in 2011,
but checking the part-of-speech tagging and the morphological analysis was left
out from the final stage.  Not only until the 2014 version of OMorFi have we
finally got morphologically verified versions of the Finnish Treebank1 and 2
corpora with a version of OMorFi that is fully compatible with the corpora.
While including missing lexical items in OMorFi making sure that the correct
base form and analysis is delivered by OMorFi, the corpora were corrected to
make sure that the gold standard words are correctly analyzed in context.
Currently the dependency tagging is reverified against the final version of the
dependency tagging manual. 

\section{Development Motivated by Applications}

Below we describe the development that was needed to accommodate OMorFi for some of its current applications.

\subsection{Spell Checking}

More precise paradigm and inflectional descriptions.

\subsection{Part-Of-Speech Tagging}

Systematic ambiguities encapsulated in certain cases: ...

\subsection{Named-Entity Recognition}

Names of persons, locations and organizations have been compiled from various
publicly available Finnish name sources on the internet.  Finnish named entity
recognition based on OMorFi was tested on large corpora of news paper text and
some frequent but unknown words were added.  Finnish NER was tested in an
application called the software news room \cite{huovelinsoftware} developed in
cooperation with Finnish media houses. 

\subsection{Dependency Parsing}

Clearer distinctions between approx. 100 high-frequent adverbs and particles
have been made using corpus data and collocations as well as the large Finnish
grammar \cite{visk}.

\subsection{Machine Translation}

For example for morphological analysis of Finnish, it is sufficient to treat
the so-called past-participle form as a single entity~(\ref{gloss:pcp}).
However, in applications that need to do syntactic parsing or semantic
annotation, it becomes apparent that at least three uses of the participle are
separate enough to warrant different analyses to facilitate correct use: a past
negative construction~(\ref{gloss:pcp-conneg}), a perfect or pluperfect
construction~(\ref{gloss:pcp-past}) or a derivation yielding a common
adjective~(\ref{gloss:pcp-drv}). This separation is most important during
syntactic disambiguation, which in turn is used by e.g., machine translation to
avoid such translations as \emph{I (did) not looked} or \emph{presentation's
looked}.

\begin{exe}
    \ex \label{gloss:pcp}
    \gll \bf katso-nut \\
    \small look-\textsc{Pst.Ptcp.Sg} \\
    \glt `looked'
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
    \ex \label{gloss:pcp-conneg}
    \gll \bf en \bf katso-nut \\
    \small \textsc{Neg.V.1sg} \small look-\textsc{Past.ConNeg.Sg} \\
    \glt `I didn't look'
    \ex \label{gloss:pcp-past}
    \gll \bf ole-n \bf katso-nut \\
    \small be-\textsc{pres.1sg} \small look-\textsc{Past.Ptcp.Sg} \\
    \glt `I have looked' \\
    \ex \label{gloss:pcp-drv}
    \gll \bf esitelmÃ¤-n \bf katsonut \\
    \small presentation-\textsc{Sg.Gen} \small look[\textsc{Sg.Nom}] \\
    \glt `who has seen the presentation'
\end{exe}

\section{Test Data}

To test the impact of the modifications, we use the following test data sets:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finnish Europarl Corpus published in 20xx: modern legal text, 37,616,194 tokens \cite{koehn2005europarl}
\item Finnish JRC-Aquis Corpus published in 20xx: modern legal text, 47,711,286 tokens \cite{steinberger2006jrc}
\item Gutenberg Corpus: older literary texts from 18xx-18xx, 35,839,524 tokens,\footnote{\url{http://project-gutenberg.com}}
\item Finnish Wikipedia accessd in 20xx: modern scholarly prose, 55,231,863 tokens,\footnote{\url{http://fi.wikipedia.org}}
\item FinnTreeBank1: morphologically disambiguated and dependency annotated selection of linguistically motivated sample sentences: 
         162,029 tokens, 
\item FinnTreeBank2: morphologically disambiguated and dependency annotated selection of unrestricted text: 
         4.000 tokens, \cite{voutilainen2011finntreebank}
\item Gutenberg subsection: 100.000 tokens of unrestricted text from 18xx-18xx
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coverage}

test data sets:

\begin{itemize}
\item Token coverage: word form is found in OMorFi
\item Lemma coverage: lemma is found in OMorFi
\item Analysis coverage: correct analysis is found in OMorFi

\subsection{Implementation Characteristics}

To verify that the finite-state technology behaves as expected, i.e. no speed
increase is incurred by the lexicon extension.  We compare the OMorFi 2011 and
2014 versions of the finite-state implementations of the lexicons.
