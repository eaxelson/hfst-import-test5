===================================================
 This is a catchall file for all hfst-related bugs
===================================================

Most of the bugs in this file have been reported via official bug tracker,
which currently is email box <hfst-bugs@helsinki.fi>. For full listing of fixed
bugs and changes, see ChangeLog.

Bugs w.r.t. supported Xerox tool idiosyncracies
-----------------------------------------------

The automatic handling of flag diacritics, i.e. parsing symbols of form
@?.*@ as special epsilons with side effects is only implemented in
hfst-compose-intersect, hfst-compose, hfst-lookup and hfst-optimized-lookup.
Handling them as epsilons for other tools that may require them to be treated
as epsilons does not work.

The handling of # or .#. as automatic border of automaton symbol is only
supported in hfst-twolc and hfst-compose-intersect.

Unresolved Bugs
---------------

- Library should provide package-config .pc-files and stable API and reliable
  version numbering.

- Library headers should not reveal underlying variables or structures, nor
  cause all compilations to report warnings from bugs of underlying libraries.

- Transducer reading will segfault with files which have a header that is
  potentially valid HFST, SFST or OpenFST transducer header but rest of the
  file is faulty.

- hfst-lookup tokenizes left-to-right longest match, hfst-optimized-lookup ditto
  except with ASCII where all ASCII are one arc.

Resolved bugs
-------------

- Better handling of R.X and D.X flag diacritics in r178

- Fixed platform dependent end-state parsing bugs in r157

- Possibility to treat flag diacritics as epsilons in hfst-compose partially in
  r146

- Handle # as special symbol in lexc and twolc, mostly fixed in r120

- Mac OS X gettext / autopoint failures, resolved in r150 by removal of gettext

- libtool version 1 vs. 2 macros, partially resolved in r127

- hfst-twolc escaped and low ascii symbol issues, Resolved in r97, r125

- hfst-lookup does not allow non-ascii in readline on Mac OS X, resolved in r85
  by removal of readline

- hfst-fst2string -u -n -w

- hfst-lookup formats: Resolved in r63:69, r76:77

- “hfst-optimized-lookup not accepting file input” Resolved in documentation

- (FIXED in development branch)
  The currently (elsewhere) distributed German transducer, german.hfst, fails
  under hfst-lookup with

  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
    what():  std::bad_alloc
  Aborted

  The optimized lookup version, german.hfst.ol, works fine however.
