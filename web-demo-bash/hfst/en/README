General
-------

This is an English morphological transducer.  It is meant for analysis, and thus overgenerates by allowing a large number of prefixes and suffixes.  The exceptions lexicon and parts of the main lexicon are based on WordNet 2.0 (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/license/).  The grammar itself is licensed under the Gnu General Public License.

Compilation
-----------

Requires the files lexicon.lex and exceptions.lex

Compiles with foma (http://foma.sourceforge.net):

foma -l english.script

This constructs the main transducer. Parsing is from bottom to top, i.e. the command "up <word>" will parse a verb, etc.
