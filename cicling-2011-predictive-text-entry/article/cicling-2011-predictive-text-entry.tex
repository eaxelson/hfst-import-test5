\begin{abstract}

Linguistic models for predictive text entry on ambiguous keyboards
typically rely on large dictionaries including word frequenies, which
are used to disambiguate between words matching user input. This
approach is insufficient for heavily agglutinative languages, like
Finnish or Turkish, where morphological phenomena such as inflection
and compounding increase the rate of out-of-vocabulary words. We
propose a method for text entry, which circumvents the problem of
out-of-vocabulary words, by replacing the dictionary with a Markov
chain on morpheme sequences constructed from morphologically segmented
training data. The Markov chain is combined with a third order hidden
Markov model (HMM) mapping key sequences to letter
sequences. Additionally we use rules, which enforce phonotactic
restrictions such as vowel harmony in Finnish. We evaluate our method
by constructing text entry systems for Finnish and Turkish mobile
phone keypads. We compare the Turkish text entry system with an
existing system, which is based on an HMM of letter sequences
\cite{Tantug:2010} and show that we achieve superior results measured
by the keystrokes per character ratio (KPC)
\cite{MacKenzie02kspc}. We also compare the Finnish text entry system
to an existing system, which utilizes a morphological analyzer
combined with a colloquial dictionary \cite{silfverberg/2011/cla} and
show that we achieve superior KPC. For segmenting the training data,
we use Morfessor, a system for unsupervised morphological segmentation
\cite{Creutz07ACMTSLP}. For constructing the probabilistic models
needed for the text entry systems, we use tools for POS tagging from
the HFST interface \cite{Silfverberg/2011}, which is an open-source
interface for weighted finite-state calculus. We also utilize an
open-source two-level phonology rule compiler, hfst-twolc, for
implementing the vowel harmony rules needed for text entry of Finnish
\cite{hfst/2011}.

\section{Training Materials and Test Materials for Finnish and Turkish}

\subsection{Finnish}

For training and testing the Finnish text entry system, we use the
same data as \cite{silfverberg/2011/cla}, though they use a
morphological analyzer, which we do not utilize. The training material is extracted from Finnish IRC logs and contains some 350000 words. The test material is actual text message data and contains $6663$ words~\footnote{The original test data contains $10851$ words, but it turned out that the latter part of the test data file is actually a list of unique words, which would skew test results, so we decided to only use the earlier half of the material}. 

\subsection{Turkish}

For training and testing the Turkish text entry system, we use the
same materials as \cite{Tantug:2010}. The material is divided into a
test corpus containing $2597$ words and a training corpus which
includes the rest of the words in the material. Thus the training data
and test data are disjoint.

\section{Evaluation}

In this section, we present the results of experiments using the
Finnish and Turkish training data and test data presented in the
previous section. For Finnish we examine the impact of varying the
amount of training data on the performance of the predictive text
entry system. For Turkish we present results on the whole test
material.

\subsection{The Keystrokes Per Characters Ratio}

Many factors influence the efficiency of mobile phone text entry in
practice. E.g. the general user interface design of the phone and
specifically the design of the keyboard have a large
impact. Nevertheless such factors are in some sense isolated from the
predictive text entry algorithm itself, which makes it plausible to
evaluate the algorithms in isolation from the rest of the user
interface of mobile phones. In this paper we use the keystrokes per
character (KPC) ratio~\cite{MacKenzie02kspc} for measuring the
efficiency of text entry. It measures the average number of keystrokes
required to input one letter in a text message. As a measure of the
efficiency of predictive text input, keystrokes per character leaves
something to be desired, since it in no way incorporates factors such
as cognitive workload, but such factors could not be adequately
addressed in a paper on computational linguistics. Moreover they
cannot be studied in isolation from the user interface of the mobile
phone.

The keystroke per character ratio is computed on test data as the
ratio of keystrokes used to enter the data using a given text entry
method and the number of letters in the words in the data. Following
\cite{Tantug:2010}, we do not consider space characters as a part of
the test data.

For the multitap method inputting the Finnish word "kukka" (flower) on
a typical Finnish 12-key mobile phone keyboard requires 10 keystrokes
as shown in figure~\ref{kukka-kpc}. Hence the KPC ratio for test data
consisting of the single word "kukka" would be $10/5 = 2.0$.

For our own method we compute KPC similarly as for multitap, by
dividing the number of keystrokes used by the number of letters in the
test data. If our method cannot provide the correct suggestion for
some input sequence, we use multitap as a fallback method. Naturally
we cannot know that a word is not given by the text entry method
before scrolling through all of the suggestions, so entering an
unknown word requires:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Entering the keys used to write the word (one keystroke per letter)
\item Scrolling through the suggestions ($9$ keystrokes in the current system, since there are $10$ suggestions)
\item Deleting the last suggestion one letter at a time (one keystroke per letter)
\item Switching to multitap mode (one keystroke)
\item Inputting the word in multitap mode (keystroke count varies depending on the word).
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{new-method-kpc-known} demonstrates how KPC is computed for
entering the word "\"{o}it\"{a}" (nights) using our own text entry
method. The figure \ref{new-method-kpc-unknown} shows inputting the word "subi" (probably a
Finnish version of sub). The correct form of "subi" is not found using our text
entry method, which means we need to use multitap as fallback.

Thus inputting "subi" requires $4 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 11 + 1 = 30$ keystrokes.} \label{new-method-kpc-unknown}
