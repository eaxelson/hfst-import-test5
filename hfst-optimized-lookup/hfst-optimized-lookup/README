	https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome

For installing instructions, see INSTALL. Briefly,
the usual

	./configure
	make
	(as root) make install

should result in a local installation and

	make uninstall

in its uninstallation. If you would rather install in eg. your home directory
(or aren't the system administrator), you can tell ./configure:

	./configure --prefix=$HOME
