hfst-optimized-lookup-java: a demo utility for lookup on hfst-optimized-lookup
transducers.

You need the Java runtime, a transducer in a special fast-lookup format
(made with separate hfst tools) and this package.

src/ contains .java source files and precompiled .class files.

If you got this from svn, you'll need to compile first, ie.

	javac src/net/sf/hfst/*.java

To run (assuming you didn't get this from a .jar), you need to make sure
the classpath is set to where the compiled classes are, so
"java -cp src/ HfstOptimizedLookup [name of transducer]"
