	* Added character swaps to edit distance script. You have to enable
	  them with
	  the -s flag - they generate A(A-1)*D new states and twice that
	  many
	  transitions, where A is the size of the alphabet and D is the
	  edit distance.
	  Pretty expensive. Is there a better way?

	  Basic functionality including OTHER symbol (@?@) and runtime
	  alphabet
	  translation is present; weighted transducers (probably to be the
	  only option)
	  and flag diacritic states for the mutator and lexicon
	  forthcoming.
