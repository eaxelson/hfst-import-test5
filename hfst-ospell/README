hfst-ospell library and toy commandline tester

This is a minimal hfst optimized lookup format based spell checker library and
a demonstrational implementation of command line based spell checker. The
library is licenced under Apache licence version 2, other licences can be
obtained from University of Helsinki.

Usage in external programs:

	#include <ospell.h>

and compile your project with

	-lhfst-ospell

Dependencies:
	-libxml2
	(from the gnome project, eg. the package libxml++2.6-dev in Debian)
	-zlib
	(a compression library, eg. the package zlib1g-dev in Debian)
	-libarchive
	(eg. the package libarchive-dev in Debian)

The library lives in a namespace called hfst_ol. Pass (weighted!) Transducer
pointers to the Speller constructor, eg.:

	FILE * error_source = fopen(error_filename, "r");
	FILE * lexicon_file = fopen(lexicon_filename, "r");
	hfst_ol::Transducer * error;
	hfst_ol::Transducer * lexicon;
	try {
		error = new hfst_ol::Transducer(error_source);
		lexicon = new hfst_ol::Transducer(lexicon_file);
	} catch (hfst_ol::TransducerParsingException& e) {
			/* problem with transducer file, usually completely
			different type of file - there's no magic number
			in the header to check for this */
		}
	hfst_ol::Speller * speller;
	try {
		speller = new hfst_ol::Speller(error, lexicon);
	} catch (hfst_ol::AlphabetTranslationException& e) {
		/* problem with translating between the two alphabets */
	}


And use the functions

	// returns true if line is found in lexicon
	bool hfst_ol::Speller::check(char * line);

	// CorrectionQueue is a priority queue, sorted by weight
	hfst_ol::CorrectionQueue hfst_ol::Speller::correct(char * line);

to communicate with it. See main.cc for a concrete usage example. It provides a
demo utility with the following help message:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The command line program:

Usage: hfst-ospell [OPTIONS] ERRORSOURCE LEXICON
Run a composition of ERRORSOURCE and LEXICON on standard input and
print corrected output

  -h, --help                  Print this help message
  -V, --version               Print version information
  -v, --verbose               Be verbose
  -q, --quiet                 Don't be verbose (default)
  -s, --silent                Same as quiet
