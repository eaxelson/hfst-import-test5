% Comment to remove before submission:
% the relatively insignificant material here should really be incorporated into
% another section..
There has been considerable progress in achieving HSFT's goal of acting as a
compatibility layer between different representations of finite-state
transducers and, more importantly, the operations and formalisms (eg.
\verb+lexc/twolc+, \verb+xfst+, \verb+sfst+) that have been implemented
for them. HFST is now independent of any particular library and requires no
custom extensions to the libraries it uses.

\subsection{Dynamic Linking to Underlying Libraries}
Previously HFST relied on custom extensions to the libraries it supported,
namely OpenFst and SFST, and it was necessary to statically link them into
\verb+libhfst+. This was obviously also rather restrictive in terms of
new versions and different use cases (eg. experimentation with local changes to
the underlying libraries.

HFST3 supports conditional compilation of all its elements that provide
interfaces to underlying libraries, and dynamic linking is done to whichever
libraries the user configures HFST3 to use.

\subsection{Stand-alone Use and Flexibility}
Due to these improvements, HFST3 can also be built without any external
libraries (in which case only the operations for a simple internal
representation and optimized-lookup (see section \ref{optimized-lookup}),
building from text representation and fast lookup will be supported) or only
the user's self-made library, which will then support compilation to
optimized-lookup format.
